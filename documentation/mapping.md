# Mapping

## Introduction

Basemap is a library used to visualise maps in python. It allows points and boundries to be easily drawn and incorperated within our notebooks. Here is an example:

## Instalation

Unfortunately the installation of Basemap is poorly documented. After a few attempts I found the following succesfull steps:

    git clone https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap.git
    cd basemap
    pip install .

Once installed, run the following test:

    cd examples
    python simpletest.py
